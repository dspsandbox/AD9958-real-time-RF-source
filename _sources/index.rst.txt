INTRODUCTION 
************
The AD9958 Python library provides a configurable and harware timed interface for a AD9948 DDS. The defined commands are sent over the provided serial port to the chipKit max32 microcontroller and loaded onto the onboard task stack. 
Once the task stack gets started, the saved commands are issued sequentially and the AD9958 gets programed over SPI in real time. Please check the provided examples for more details on the different operational modes.
