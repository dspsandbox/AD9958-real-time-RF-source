INTRODUCTION 
************
The AD9958 Python library provides a configurable and harware timed interface for a AD9948 DDS. The defined commands are sent over the provided serial port to the chipKit max32 microcontroller and loaded onto the onboard task stack. 
Once the task stack gets started, the saved commands are performed in a sequential. 

Some highlighted capabilities are:
	* **Single tone mode**.
	* **Modulation mode**: 2,4,8, or 16 bit for amplitude, frequency and phase.
	* **Sweep mode** for amplitude, frequency and phase.
	* Simplified setting of **amplitude, frequency and phase registers**.
	* Set **profile PINs on AD9958**.
	* **Internal timer** (~62.5ns step size, ~125ns minimum delay time).
	* Wait for **trigger in**.
	* Set **trigger out**.
